# Voron V2.4 Mods
 
This repo contains mods I've created for the Voron 2.4. More will be added.

Klipper config, scripts and macros etc are in my klipper config repo: https://github.com/LeeHeap/Klipper-config

## LED corners
A recreated version of [richardjm's LED 15.5mm quarter round mounts](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/blob/master/printer_mods/richardjm/led-mounts) with some improvements:
* Optional colour accented voron logo insert. This can also be printed in transparent filament and have an LED mounted behind it to make a glowing logo
* Thicker stronger shell 
* Recessed screw channel so the screw is kept out of sight
* Space to pass through a cable from the top extrusions to the vertical extrusion. Great for top-mounted webcams etc.
* Compatible with V2.4 R2 idlers. The previous design rubbed on my r2 idler wheels

## Skirt buttons
A microswitch encasing button, useful for klipper macros, lighting control etc. Easy to print and install, snaps together.
